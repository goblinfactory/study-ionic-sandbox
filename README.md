# study-ionic-sandbox

sandbox playground for various ionic experiments - not meant as a public reference. I'm taking more manual notes in my A5 notebook, so don't expect this to be kept as up to date as often as my study-angular project.

Some of the code will be code I've written myself, and other code will most likely be copies of code from `@smichelotti` 's [Ionic2Course](https://github.com/smichelotti/Ionic2Course) as Ive decided to go once through copying his app, before starting my own throw away app based around the learning from the course. [Here is Steve Michelotti's course, `building Mobile Apps with Ionic 2, Angular 2, and Typescript` on pluralsight.](https://github.com/smichelotti/Ionic2Course)
